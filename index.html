          <h2>What is {{site.title}} ?</h2>
          <p>Although the image synthesis softwares produce renders more and more realistic, one of this principal challenge is the reproduction of the lightâ€™s comportement, either through a volume as glass, or on the meeting of a surface, such as the steel or the fabric.</p>
          <p>To meet this challenge, researchers and engineers develop new algoritms and rendering engines each day. The question is how to check the validity of this new rendering engines? How to know if the final render is accurate?</p>
          <p>This is there that intervenes the project {{site.title}}.</p>
          <p>This is an <a href="http://www.ingenieur-imac.fr/" alt="IMAC ingenieur">IMAC</a> student project powered by Ubisoft to test renders and global illumination. Based on the model of the Cornell Box, our projet has as a goal to provide to all persons who work in the research and the development link to the image synthesis, a set of data that we have realised and it is going to serve as a reference. This set is composed of a group of photographies and 3D models of a calibrated scene all the characteristics of which we know (size, position of the elements, colors, camera parameters and light profile). Every element highlights the various behavior of the light going of the simplest, enlighten the scene, in the most complex, by crossing volume such as of the glass or the water.</p>
          <p>In this way every person wishing to check its rendering engine will have only to import the scene in its rendering engine, to make a render, and to compre this with the photography of corresponding reference to know the valid points or to improve.</p>
